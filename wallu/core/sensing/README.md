# Sensing

## Overview
These libraries allow the Arduino program to read in various sensors.

| Module | Device | Purpose |
| ------ | ------ | ------- |
| `rpm.*` | Arduino | Reads hall sensor input, converts to RPM.|
| `sensor.*` | Arduino | Provides a sensor template for other sensor libraries to use.|

## Known Bugs

## Future Improvements
- Implement sensing into main Arduino program
