# Core

## Overview
All files in these directories are the main components to WALL-U's onboard Arduino.

| Module | Device | Purpose |
| ------ | ------ | ------- |
| `comms` | Arduino | Takes in Serial input, converts flags for main program.|
| `motor` | Arduino | Takes various motor inputs from comms, converts to motor outputs.|
| `sensing` | Arduino | Reads sensor data|

## Known Bugs
- Check respective directory READMEs

## Future Improvements
- Implement sensing into main Arduino program
